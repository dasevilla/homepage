<p>Chester loved the woods. He would pick up the scent of a squirrel (the existence of which was always in question) and bound off after it. Really bound &mdash; his back legs would kick up in unison, a sort of hopping motion that if not particularly efficient was a delight to watch. He was a keen hunter of squirrels, moths, birds, chipmunks, but as far as I can remember he never caught any living thing.</p>
<br>
<p>When he was a pup he'd routinely disappear into the woods for several minutes. I'd play a trick on him and hide behind a tree &mdash; he'd come back and look around for me, confused. Sometimes he'd smell me out. Other times he'd get stuck and whimper a bit. When this happened I'd whisper: "Chester! Find me!" His hearing was amazing when he wanted it to be.</p>
<br>

<p>Once he ran off with a couple of Weimaraners. Thirty minutes later the Weimaraners came back without him. These woods were unfamiliar to him and it was winter, well below freezing. We looked for him for hours with no luck, and started to really worry. A stranger approached my dad and told him to go home, get a towel or something that has the dog's smell on it, and leave it on the ground near our car. We did that and in the early morning there was a very tired, very cold Chester, only a hundred yards from the car. He slept for a full day and didn't run off so much after that.</p>
<br>

<p>Today I lay down next to my dog for the last time. He rested his chin on my outstretched arm and fell asleep. His head was very heavy. The sedatives had kicked in. We laid like that for a long time waiting for the vet to come. I was careful not to move my arm but I don't think it would have mattered. I shut my eyes and remembered him as a young puppy, when he used to trip on his long ears and slide across the floor. I remembered doing agility training with him in a barn in Mt. Kisco. He was an able jumper, but struggled on the downward slope of the A-frame. I think he was in it for the food, mostly. I remembered him singing with me when I played the piano. We were a talentless duo.</p>
<br>

<p>I heard the vet's car roll up the driveway and I wasn't ready to say goodbye but that's not the way these things go. He didn't suffer. He didn't wake up again.</p>
<br>

<p>This photo is from the last walk I took him on. There's a trail near my parents' house in Connecticut that runs along the Shepaug river and around a pond. In those last days he had trouble walking but on this particular trail he almost looked like his own self. He lumbered down the hill, ears swinging, legs kicking up just a bit as he picked up momentum. We walked for maybe a mile and turned around at a fallen tree. Going back up the hill was hard on him, and as we got to the end I picked him up and carried him for the last few yards. He was panting heavily, and I could feel his heart beating a mile a minute, he had nothing left and he was happy.</p>
