<p>I canceled my cable, now life's so much better.</p>
<p>That's why they call it Time Warner, ya know? It really is.</p>
<p>I don't watch TV anymore. Well, just Netflix. And HBO Go.</p>
<p>And of course I stream the sports games. I mean, bars are so lame</p>
<p>You're not on Twitter? You're not watching at all??

<p>I can't believe what y'all are missing! It's the NBA Finals, 
<p>right here in my kitchen.</p>
