<p>A prisoner, having secured a pencil and a small scrap of paper, wants to cram in as much text as possible. So he avoids words with ascenders (bdhfjklt) and descenders (jpgpqy).

This is the shaky premise of the Prisonerâ€™s Constraint, an Oulipian writing game.

The Prisoner's Keyboard is a customizable creative writing experience. Install the keyboard, then constrain yourself to using only certain letters. You could go with the Prisoner's Constraint, a vowel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram">lipogram</a>, or create your own constraint.

If you're having fun and want to share your work, be sure to submit it!

The Prisoner's Keyboard was made with love by Nick Barr. Give me a shout on <a href="http://twitter.com/nsbarr">Twitter</a> with any feedback or just to say Hi.</p>
