<p>A prisoner, having secured a pencil and a small scrap of paper, wants to cram in as much text as possible. So he avoids words with ascenders (bdhfjklt) and descenders (jpgpqy).</p>
<p>
This is the premise of the Prisoner's Constraint, an Oulipian writing game.</p>
<p>
The Prisoner's Keyboard is a customizable creative writing experience. Install the keyboard, then remove particular letters using the lock icon. You can go with the Prisoner's Constraint, a vowel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram">lipogram</a>, or create your own constraint.</p>
