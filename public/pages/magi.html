      <p>Now as at all times I can see in the mind's eye,</p>
      <p>In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones</p>
      <p>Appear and disappear in the blue depths of the sky</p>
      <p>With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,</p>
      <p>And all their helms of silver hovering side by side,</p>
      <p>And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,</p>
      <p>Being by Calvary's turbulence unsatisfied,</p>
      <p>The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.</p>
