<h1>Frost (1963)</h1>
<img class="bernheads" src="./images/3bernhards.png">
<p>A medical internship consists of more than spectating at complicated bowel operations, cutting open stomach linings, bracketing off lungs, and sawing off feet; and it doesn't just consist of thumbing closed the eyes of the dead, and hauling babies out into the world either.</p>

<h1>The Lime Works (1970)</h1>
<img class="bernheads" src="./images/1bernhards.png">
<p>...when Kondrad bought the lime works, about five and a half years ago, the first thing he moved in was a piano he set up in his room on the first floor, according to the gossip at the Laska tavern, not because of any artistic leanings, says Wieser, the manager of the Mussner estate, but for relaxation, to ease the nervous strain caused by decades of unremitting brain work, says Fro, the man in charge of the Trattner estate, agreeing that Konrad's piano playing had nothing to do with art, which Konrad hates, but was just improvisation, as Wieser says, for an hour first thing early in the morning and another late at night, every day, spent at the keyboard, with the metronome ticking away, the windows open...</p>

<h1>Correction (1975)</h1>
<img class="bernheads" src="./images/4bernhards.png">
<p>After a mild pulmonary infection, tended too little and too late, had suddenly turned into a severe pneumonia that took its toll of my entire body and laid me up for at least three months at nearby Wels, which has a hospital renowned in the field of so-called internal medicine, I accepted an invitation from Hoeller, a so-called taxidermist in the Aurach valley, not for the <i>end</i> of October, as the doctors urged, but for <i>early</i> in October, as I insisted, and then went on my own so-called responsibility <i>straight</i> to the Aurach valley and to Hoeller's house, without even a detour to visit my parents in Stocket, straight into the so-called Hoeller garret, to begin sifting and perhaps even arranging the literary remains of my friend, who was also a friend of the taxidermist Hoeller, Roithamer, after Roithamer's suicide, I went to work sifting and sorting the papers he had willed to me, consisting of thousands of slips covered with Roithamer's handwriting plus a bulky manuscript entitled "About Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, with special attention to the Cone."</p>

<h1>Yes (1978)</h1>
<img class="bernheads" src="./images/3bernhards.png">
<p>The Swiss and his <i>woman friend</i> had appeared at the real-estate agent Moritz's place at just the moment when, for the first time, I was trying not only to outline to him the symptoms of my emotional and mental sickness and eventually elucidate them as a science, but had come to Moritz's house, who in point of fact was then probably the person closest to me, in order quite suddently and in the most ruthless manner to turn the inside of my, by then not just sickly but totally sickness-ridden, existence, which until then he had known just superficially and had not therefore been unduly irritated let alone alarmed by in any way, turn that inside of my existence out, and thus inevitably <i>alarmed and appalled</i> him by the very abrupt brutality of my undertaking, by the fact that, on that afternoon, I totally unveiled and revealed what, over the whole decade of my acquaintance and friendship with Moritz, I had kept hidden from him, indeed concealed from him throughout that period with mathematical ingeniousness, and kept continually (and pitlessly towards myself) covered from him, in order not to grant him, Mortiz, even the slightest glimpse into my existence, which profoundly horrified him, but I had not allowed that horror to impede me in hte least in my revealing mechanism which had, that afternoon and of course also under the influence of the weather, gone into action, and step by step, that afternoon, I had, as though I had no other choice, all of a sudden pounced upon Moritz from my mental ambush, unveiling <i>everything</i> relating to myself, <i>un</i>veiling everything that there was to unveil, <i>revealing</i> everything there was to <i>reveal</i>; throughout the incident I had been seated, as always, in the corner seat facing the two windows by the entrance to Moritz's office, to what I always called his box-file room, while Mortiz himself, after all this was the end of October, sat facing me in his mouse-grey winter overcoat, possibly by then in a drunk state, which in the falling dusk I had been unable to determine; I had not, all that time, let my eyes leave him, it was as if that afternoon, after many weeks when I had not been to the Mortiz house and had completely been on my own, which means reduced to my own head and to my own body, for a very long, though not yet nerve-wrecking, time in a state of utmost concentration <i>about everything</i>, resolved to do <i>anything</i> that promised me salvation, and finally, leaving my damp and cold and dark house and crossing the dense and sombre wood, pounced on Moritz as though on a life-saving sacrifice in order, as I had determined on my way to Moritz's house, to persist in my revelations and therefore downright improper hurts until I had reached a tolerable degree of relief, which meant until I had unveiled and revealed as much as possible of my existence which for many years I had concealed from him.</p>

<h1>Concrete (1982)</h1>
<img class="bernheads" src="./images/3bernhards.png">
<p>From March to December, writes Rudolf, while I was having to take large quantities of prednisolone, a fact which I am bound to record here, against the third acute onset of my sarcoidosis, I assembled every possible book and article written by or about Mendelssohn Bartholdy and visited every possible and impossible library in order to acquaint myself thoroughly with my favourite composer and his work, preparing myself with the most passionate seriousness for the task, which I had been dreading throughout the preceding winter, of writing — such was my pretension — a major work of impeccable scholarship.</p>

<p>While everyone was waiting for the actor, who had promised to join the dinner party in the Gentzgasse after the premiere of <i>The Wild Duck</i>, I observed the Auersbergers carefully from the same wing chair I had sat in nearly every day during the fifties, reflecting that it had been a grave mistake to accept their invitation.</p>

<h1>Extinction (1986)</h1>
<img class="bernheads" src="./images/5bernhards.png">
<p>On the twenty-ninth, having returned from Wolfsegg, I met my pupil Gambetti on the Pincio to discuss arrangements for the lessons he was to receive in May, writes Franz-]osef Murau, and impressed once again by his high intelligence, I was so refreshed and exhilarated, so glad to be living in Rome and not in Austria, that instead of walking home along the Via Condotti, as I usually do, I crossed the Flaminia and the Piazza del Popolo and walked the whole length of the Corso before returning to my apartment in the Piazza Minerva, where at about two o'clock I received the telegram informing me that my parents and my brother, Johannes, had died.</p>
