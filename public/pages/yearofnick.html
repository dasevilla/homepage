  	<h1>Year of Nick</h1>
  	<p>2015 is my year of public, personal, collaborative building.</p><p>Is it also the Year of You? Get in touch (nsbarr@gmail.com) and let's jam together.</p>
  	<p>Here's what the year looks like so far:</p>
  	</section>
  	<section id="list">
  		<h2 id="live">Live</h2>
  		<ul>
  			<li><h3>HAM</h3>Short for Hard As a Motherfucker, HAM is a methodology for rapidly turning ideas into prototypes. The v1 of HAM lives on GitHub. As projects get completed using HAM, I will launch wegoham.com and iterate on the methodology.<p><a href="https://github.com/nsbarr/HAM">Visit Site&rarr;</a></p></li>  
  		</ul>
  		<h2 id="inprogress">In Progress</h2>
  		<ul>
  			<li><h3>l8r</h3>An iOS app that transforms how we store and recall memories. Currently seeking design and development collaborators.
  			<li><h3>The Product Deck</h3>A deck of cards meant to support -- or replace -- the product manager in your organization. 
  		</ul>
  		<h2 id="backlog">Backlog</h2>
  		<ul>
  			<li><h3>PROCEED</h3>A zine/cookbook for generative poetry. Every entry consists of the poem, the procedure for generating it, and parameters for changing it.</li>
  			<li><h3>WWJD</h3>An on-the-go messaging app for asking what Jesus would do in your situation. Sort of a reading comprehension test for myself after reading <i>The Gospel in Brief</i>.</li>
  			<li><h3>ohNYC</h3>A dynamic fridge magnets game for iOS with words populated by a twitter hashtag (#ohNYC is overheard in NYC).
  			<li><h3>Busk</h3>An iOS app for requesting and delivering "X about Y" â€” eg., poem about orchids, song about your pet rock, etc. A continuation of a poetry integration with Twilio I did last year.
  			<li><h3>3Things</h3>A diary app for iOS that lets you track three things of your choosing. I'm using a prototype to track whether I was a vegetarian, pescetarian, or carnivore daily.</li>
  		</ul>
  		<h2 id="onice">On Ice</h2>
  		<ul>
  			<li><h3>MasterPass</h3> MasterPass is a word game for iOS -- a cross between Hangman and Mastermind. I haven't submitted to the App Store yet, as I think it needs more polish.</li>
  			<li><h3>Untitled Panda Project</h3> A panda abondons his cushy life on the nature reserve to seek answers that can only be found in the wild. I have a rough first draft of the screenplay.</li>
  		</ul>
