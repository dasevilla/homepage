 <p><i>The Prisoner's Keyboard</i> is a keyboard extension built for creative writing. It is available for iPhone and iPad <a href="http://appstore.com/theprisonerskeyboard">here</a>.</p>
 <p>The premise of the Prisoner's Constraint is as follows. A prisoner, having secured a pencil and a small scrap of paper, wants to cram in as much text as possible. So he avoids words with ascenders (<i>bdhfjklt</i>) and descenders (<i>jpgpqy</i>).</p>
 <p>The Prisoner's Keyboard lets composers create this and other constraints by removing letters from the mobile keyboard:</p>

 <p>Once forbidden letters are removed, the composer regains the freedom to generate permissible text with the keyboard.</p>
 <p>Here is the output of the poem generated in the video.</p>
